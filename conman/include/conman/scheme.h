     * startHook() mechanism. If it is currently running, it is considered
     * enabled.
     *
     * This is where block conflicts get checked. If enabling this port
     * conflicts with another block (like if enabling it would violate the
     * exclusivity of an input port), then it will not be enabled unless force
     * is specificed as true. If force is specified, then any conflicting
     * blocks will be disabled, themselves.
     *
     * This attempts to start() the block, which requires that the block be
     * configured before enableBlock() is called. This is because calls to
     * configure() may block for unacceptable lengths of time.
     *
     *
     * <b> Disabling Blocks </b>
     *
     * "Disabling" a block corresponds to stopping it through RTT's normal
     * stopHook() mechanism. If it is not currently running, a block is
     * considered disabled.
